# COVID-19 Dashboard 
This dashbord is based on, [covid19_dashboard](https://github.com/chschoenenberger/covid19_dashboard)
(by Christoph Schoenenberger), an open source project to show the developments of COVID-19 pandemic.

**Disclaimer:** The project is for visualization and learning purposes. The author is not epidemiologist or health expert.
The project is still in adaptation mode and many constants refear to the original version ('Contries' instead of 'Provinces' appear around)

## Motivation
My idea was to show COVID-19 development on Argentina.
Also I think that geographical and **time are keys** on pandemic evolution dataviz.
I found a cute open source project and adapted to be feed on by the data source I created.
