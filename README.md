# COVID-19 Argentina - Santa Fe Dashboard 
[This dashbord](https://mariano22.shinyapps.io/covid19_dashboard/) is based on [covid19_dashboard](https://github.com/chschoenenberger/covid19_dashboard) by Christoph Schoenenberger, an open source project that shows the development of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Disclaimer:** This project is made for visualizing and learning purposes. 
The author is not an epidemiologist nor a health expert. 
The dashboard is being adapted and many constants still refer to the original version (the use of the word 'Countries' instead of 'Provinces', for example)

## Motivation
My idea was to show the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina.
I also think that **geography and time** are key elements in the pandemic evolution dataviz. 
I found a cute open source project and adapted it to be fed by the data source I created. 

## Data

- **Repo argcovidapi:** [covid19_dashboard](https://github.com/mariano22/covid19_dashboard)
- **Population data:** Wikipedia (censo 2010)

## Bugs, Issues & Enhancement Requests
If you find any bugs, issues, or have any ideas on how to improve the dashboard, please create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/mariano22/covid19_dashboard/issues).
I will do my best to look into it as soon as possible.
